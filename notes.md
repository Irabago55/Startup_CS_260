# Notes

## Git Commands
1. **Putting 2 astericks on each side of the text will make it bold**
2. Successive # from 1-3 will make headers (1 being the largest size and 3 the smallest)
3. "git pull" in the terminal will pull the latest github version I have
4. "git commit" will commit the changes in my terminal
5. "git push" will send those changes back to my github

## HTML Notes

1. "img" tag is used to display images in html. It will either have a full url from an external website or a relative url from the computer you're using. You put the url in the "src" attriubute and you can describe the image in the "alt" attribute.
2. To display audio you use the "audio" element with the "src" attribute that takes the url. If you add the "controls" element it allows the user to control the audio (which is preferred). The "autoplay" attribute plays it as soon as it loads, and the "loop" attribute plays is over and over (discouraged unless user has the option to opt into the action).
